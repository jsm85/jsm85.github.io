Over the next several posts, I will be going through some design patterns in C# and in Ruby. The motivation behind this post series is to:

1. Give me a reference point
2. Share some exmaples that have helped me understand some of these patterns
3. Aid my Ruby learning and development

The first pattern I am starting with is the Strategy Pattern

Defined as

"Blah"
