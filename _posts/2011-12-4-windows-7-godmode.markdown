<p>I stumbled across this the other day. enabling GodMode in Windows 7!! This sounded awesome. but It's basically a folder you can create that'll contain shortcuts to most of the configuration settings/services in Windows. Not as glamorous as it sounded but still quite handy. check the tutorial out <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/windows-7-god-mode/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
