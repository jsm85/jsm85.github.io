For anybody interested learning or understanding how the M-V-VM pattern works please checkout Karl Shifflet's in-the-box training <a href="http://karlshifflett.wordpress.com/2010/11/07/in-the-box-ndash-mvvm-training/" target="_blank">here</a>.

This tutorial allows you to follow the material within visual studio where the code follows the text.

Great tutorial!
