I started my career about 8 years ago, 9 if you include my internship. In that time I've seen a great improvement to the tooling that's now available to developers for **FREE**, where previously you would have had to pay quite a bit for. Visual Studio is a great example of such an improvement. The old *Express* editions of Visual Studio were free but they were not feature complete and lacked some key functionality, like the ability to add extensions, ReSharper being a critical one. Forward to 2016, well, Visual Studio Community is pretty feature heavy and is **FREE**. Visual Studio Community, along with tools and platforms like Unity, PhoneGap and many others has given developers all the tools they need to start building great apps at very little cost, if any. This is amazing! I only wish I was 18 again, with all this tooling available.

Anyway, let me get to the point of this post. Below is a list of Frameworks, Tools and Platforms that I've installed on my new machine, all of which are **FREE**:
