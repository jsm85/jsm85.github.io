Yep, you guessed it...I'm talking about TeamCity by jetbrains. It's a fairly mature product now and one I have been using for 2 Â« years but I can't praise it enough and thought it deserved some attention on my blog. Its "continuous integration for dummies" (I mean that in the nicest possible way :) ).

We have it setup for all of our projects at work. We have recently introduced automated testing (with Nunit) and code coverage (with NCover). TeamCity really has made life easier for everyone at work, especially as we work in a SCRUM environment, where code integration is so frequent.
