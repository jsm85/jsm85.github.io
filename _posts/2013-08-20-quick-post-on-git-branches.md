## A quick post on Git Branches

This is just a quick post with some git commands that I always tend to forget! Hopefully by writing about it I'll remember it from now on... wishful thinking.

- To list all branches
```
git branch -a
```    
- To List all branches that have been fully merged
```
git branch -a --merged
```    
- To delete a branch locally
```
git branch -d [BRANCH NAME]
```
