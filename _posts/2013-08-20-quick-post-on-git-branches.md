## Git branch commands

This is just a quick post with some git commands that I always tend to forget! Hopefully by writing about it I'll remember it from now on... wishful thinking.

- To list all branches

        git branch -a

- To List all branches that have been fully merged

        git branch -a --merged

- To delete a branch locally

        git branch -d [BRANCH NAME]
