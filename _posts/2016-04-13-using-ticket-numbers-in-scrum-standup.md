This is more a rant than a blog post I guess (I'll make it short).

One of my pet hates when participating in some of our Stand-Ups is when the Scrum Team members refer to the stories they are working on as ticket numbers... i.e. "Yesterday I worked on 7149, today I'm going to pick up 7153, no blockers!"

WTF is 7149?! I'm not a robot, nor do I have the entire backlog recorded in my memory by ticket number!

We all speak a common language, in our case it's English, so let's use it!
