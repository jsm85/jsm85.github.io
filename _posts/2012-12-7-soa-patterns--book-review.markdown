<p>I have just finished Reading <a href="http://www.manning.com/rotem/" target="_blank">SOA Patterns</a> by <a href="http://arnon.me/category/blog/" target="_blank">Arnon Rotem-Gal-Oz</a> and I must say I found it to be a very interesting read. Like a few other Manning books that I have read, I found this to be an easy read. I feel Arnon has done a great job keeping the content light but detailed enough, using examples, that you can grasp the concept of the pattern very easily. I particularly liked the fact that he also included a technology mapping section for each pattern so that you actually get an idea of how you would implement the pattern.</p>  <p>I had been waiting to read this book for a while and I'm glad I did. It has put the work my team and I are carrying out into perspective and I found it quite refreshing to read about challenges and solutions that we have already identified and solved in our codebase even before reading this book, making me feel that we're doing a really good job. It has also answered a few of the questions I had left unanswered regarding topics such as the composing Business Components on the screen (user interface) and reporting.</p>  <p>This is definitely a book to have to hand when designing and architecting enterprise solutions. Highly recommended!</p>
