I have finally released version 1 of the Jekyll Blog Importer utility. It is available to download [here](https://github.com/jsm85/JekyllBlogImporter/releases/tag/v1.0.0.64)

In the next few blog posts I will be writing a tutorial on how to get set up with Jekyll on Windows, migrating a blog from wordpress, creating a jekyll blog site using this [starter pack](https://github.com/jsm85/JekyllBlogStarterPack), styling the blog using [Bootswatch](http://bootswatch.com/) and deploying the blog to Github.

Stay Tuned!
